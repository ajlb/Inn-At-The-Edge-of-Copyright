## Overview

The Inn at the Edge of Copyright is a text-based program for anyone with a crave for an adventure. Our project is a MUD or Multi-User-Dungeon RPG loosely based on The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams and inspired by text-based MUDs of the early days of the internet. The Inn At The Edge is where all who are lost can find a home.
